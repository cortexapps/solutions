# Knowledge Trasfer
## A Fancy tool for moving knowledge from SaaS to self-hosted brought to you by the nuerons at Cortex!

To get this working, update the fields in kt.py to match your backend API instance info and match your SaaS and self-hosted API keys and then run a `pip3 install`. Once you've done that, simply run `python3 kt.py` and grab a cup of coffee and watch as you transfer one brain to another!
