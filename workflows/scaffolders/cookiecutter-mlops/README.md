# Cookiecutter MLOps

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for MLOps._  
* This template is presented in my tutorial : [Structuring Your Machine Learning Project with MLOps in Mind]().
* It is based on the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) template.
* It is updated to meet the MLOps workflow described in my tutorial: [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-mlops-95282f25325c#aabc).
* You can find the project in: [Project homepage](https://github.com/Chim-SO/cookiecutter-mlops).



###  Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/Chim-SO/cookiecutter-mlops


### The resulting directory structure
The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
